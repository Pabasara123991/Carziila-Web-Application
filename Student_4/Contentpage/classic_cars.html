            <p>The 1971-lamborghini-Miura is a sports car produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1966 and 1973.
                The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini's engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes of company founder, 
                who prefered powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari. </p>
            <p>This was the first supercar with a rear mid-engined two-seated layout. 
                This layout has become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars. When released, it was the fastest production road car.</p>

            <h2><b>Mercedes Benz 300 SL</b></h2>
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz 300 SL is a two-seat sports car that was produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1954 to 1957 as a gullwinged coupe and from 1957 to 1963 as a roadster. 
                This was the world's first four-stroke production passenger car to be equipped with output and efficiency enhancing direct fuel injection.  </p>
            <p>Breath-taking engine output of 215 hp (158 kW) provided a top speed of 250 km/h, depending on final drive ratio. That made the 300 SL the fastest production car of its day.
                As with the legendary racing sports car from the 1952 season, the vehicle featured consistent lightweight design throughout and a spaceframe that supported the engine, 
                transmission and axles and left no room for conventional doors.</p>

            <h2><b>Ford Mustang Boss 302</b></h2>
            <p>Not lond after the first Mustang was introduced to the public, Ford introduced the Boss 302 Mustang, which was a more powerful version of the 1964 Mustangand eventually became one of the most popular Mustang models of all time.
                Ford put a 302 cubic inch engine which was previosly produced for the Camaro and put it on the Mustang.
            Having a 302 cubic inch engine, Ford made the decision to name the car after its engine displacement making it a bizarre but rather cool connection. </p>
            <p>The Boss 302 Mustang is a special car. 
            The need for drool-worthy external looks was covered by a fiberglass front end with a combination loop bumper/grille which increased the car's overall length by three inches. The hood also featured five air intakes adding up to the aggressive style.
            Ford wanted to make everyone aware that this is not an ordinary Ford Mustang, so it added a black stripe that started from the front of the hood, and continued all the way to the side of the car ending at the rear fender.
        On the side of the front fenders, you had "Boss 302" written. Ford only produced 4,000 of these cars, making the model rare and unique like its predecessor. </p>
