            <h2><b>What Are Electric and Hybrid Cars</b></h2>
            <p>Electric and hybrid cars are innovative and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Electric cars, also known as battery electric vehicles (BEVs),
                 are entirely powered by electricity. They rely on rechargeable batteries to store energy, which is used to power an electric motor that drives the vehicle's wheels.</p> 
            <p> On the other hand, hybrid cars combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and battery. They can run on both gasoline and electricity, and the engine charges the battery while driving.</p>

            <h2><b>Tesla</b></h2>
            <p>Tesla is a pioneering and influential car company at the forefront of the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. Founded in 2003 by Elon Musk, Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.
                 The company gained widespread recognition for its innovative electric cars that combine cutting-edge technology, high performance, and sleek design. Tesla's vehicles, such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y,
                  have redefined the automotive industry, setting new standards for electric range, acceleration, and autonomous driving capabilities.</p>

        <div class="third-box-flex" id="description-3">
            <h2><b>Technology </b></h2>
            <p>Electric cars rely on advanced lithium-ion battery technology to store and deliver electricity to an electric motor that propels the vehicle.
                 These batteries have improved significantly over the years, offering higher energy density and longer ranges. Regenerative braking is another
                crucial feature in electric and hybrid vehicles, allowing them to recapture and store energy normally lost during braking, thereby increasing overall efficiency.
                 On the other hand, hybrid cars combine internal combustion engines with electric motors, utilizing sophisticated control systems to seamlessly switch between power
                sources based on driving conditions and optimize fuel efficiency. Additionally, both types of vehicles incorporate smart charging technology,
                 enabling owners to charge their cars at home or public charging stations conveniently. </p>

            <h2><b>Benefits Electric and Hybrid Cars</b></h2>
            <p>Electric and hybrid cars offer a multitude of benefits that make them attractive alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. One of the primary advantages is their 
                positive impact on the environment. Electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which helps combat climate change and improve air quality in urban areas.
                 Additionally, electric and hybrid vehicles are more energyefficient than conventional cars, resulting in reduced dependence on fossil fuels and lower operating costs for owners. With advancements in battery technology
                 , these vehicles now offer longer driving ranges, making them suitable for everyday commuting and longer trips. Moreover, electric motors provide instant torque, delivering smooth and responsive acceleration.</p>
